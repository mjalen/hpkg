#+title: HPKG
#+author: Jalen Moore

A hacky package fetcher using the git shell client.

* Why?
I am new to Common Lisp and my Quicklisp install does not like me. Thus, I decided to write a very limited, very /hacky/ way to fetch package repositories that I need for other projects. It is /very/ terrible, but it works for my purposes as is.
* Disclaimer
This toy project is *very* buggy. Use at your own risk!
* Usage
Currently there is some boilerplate to using this package.

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (load "hpkg.asd") ; Load the object file. Needed if HPKG is not located in ASDF's default object directory
  (asdf:load-system :hpkg) ; Load hpkg system.

  ;;; Define a batch of dependencies as pairs.
  (hpkg:batch-remote
   (:alexandria "https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/alexandria/alexandria"))

  ;;; Load the dependency and use!
  (asdf:load-system :alexandria)
#+end_src

Alternatively, you may add dependencies to your ASDF system!

#+begin_src common-lisp
  ;;; In 'testsystem.asd' file...
  (load "hpkg.asd")
  (asdf:load-system :hpkg)

  (hpkg:batch-remote
   (:alexandria "https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/alexandria/alexandria"))

  (defsystem #:testsystem
    ; ...system config...
    :depends-on (:alexandria)
    ; ...more system config...
    )
#+end_src
