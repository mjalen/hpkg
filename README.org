#+title: HPKG

A hacky package fetcher using the git shell client.

* Why?
I am new to Common Lisp and my Quicklisp install does not like me. Thus, I decided to write a very limited, very /hacky/ way to fetch package repositories that I need for other projects. It is /very/ terrible, but it works for my purposes as is.
* Disclaimer
This project is *very* buggy. Use at your own risk!
* Usage
Currently there is some boilerplate to using this package. See the test file for an example usage of the popular [[https://alexandria.common-lisp.dev/][Alexandria]] package. Or, see the following.

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (load "../hpkg.asd") ; Load the system file.
  (asdf:load-system :hpkg) ; Load hpkg system.

  ;;; Define a batch of dependencies as pairs.
  (hpkg:batch-remote
   (:alexandria "https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/alexandria/alexandria"))

  ;;; Load the dependency and use!
  (asdf:load-system :alexandria)
#+end_src
